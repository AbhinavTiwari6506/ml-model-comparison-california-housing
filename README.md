# Machine Learning Model Comparison – California Housing Dataset

This project compares the performance of multiple machine learning regression models on the California Housing dataset to understand how model choice impacts prediction accuracy.

## Objective
To evaluate and compare different ML models under identical conditions using standard evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
California Housing dataset (from scikit-learn), containing socioeconomic and geographic features such as median income, house age, population, latitude, and longitude.

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Results
XGBoost achieved the lowest error and highest R² score, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation in practical machine learning workflows.
